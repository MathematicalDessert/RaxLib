    So let's just get something straight first:

    Those of you protecting the server as if it's an egg, it's
    not that fucking fragile. Filtering Enabled handles most of
    the annoying exploits which affect others.

    The MAIN problem I see is the use of remotes.

    Developers seem to misunderstand how to use remotes, and for that
    matter how to secure them.

    Throughout Rax I will detail why I'm doing certain things, and why you
    should do them too.
